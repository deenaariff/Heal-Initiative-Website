<h3 class="member">Jessica Bender</h3>
<!--/.member-->Jessica grew up in the Pacific Northwest on a blackberry farm and then in Tacoma, WA. After graduating from Northwestern, she worked at the American Red Cross in the International Services Program, primarily working with local refugee and immigrant communities. She then attended the University of Washington School of Medicine, spending time in Antsirabe, Madagascar through UW’s Global Health Pathway. Jessica then moved east again to Boston University for internal medicine residency, during which time she participated in Boston Medical Center’s refugee clinic and also did a 6 week elective at JFK hospital in Monrovia, Liberia. She stayed at BU for an additional year as chief resident but is currently spending another six weeks in Liberia working with Partners in Health as a short-term clinician as part of their Ebola response. She is excited to hopefully return to Liberia through HEAL to continue to work on health system strengthening, quality improvement, and medical education.
