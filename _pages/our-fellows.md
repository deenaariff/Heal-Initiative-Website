After completing undergraduate studies at University of California, Davis, she volunteered and provided preventive and reproductive health care education to women and children in Afghani refugee camps on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. After living amongst vulnerable populations, she wanted to better understand community oriented health care of all ages in resource poor areas, eventually leading to a career in clinical medicine. She went off to Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine, where she continued work in global health through volunteering at Arco Iris Hospital in La Paz, Bolivia and completing research involving risk factors associated with heminthic infections in Assendabo, a rural village in Ethiopia.

She studied chemistry and Latin American studies at Barnard College, and attended University of Arizona for both Medical School and to complete her Masters in Public Health. She was drawn to the philosophy of Family Medicine when she worked as a promotora for a community clinic in Tucson, AZ. It seemed to be the perfect mix of caring for individuals and communities. It was a way to meld her passion for preventive care and public health with medicine, while at the same time addressing social and economic disparities and barriers to healthcare access among women, immigrants and minorities. Growing up speaking Spanish and French, the extension to global health was a natural progression. Anna has worked in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, helping to establish sustainable locally-driven medical care, train lay health workers and help indigenous communities conduct health needs assessments. During her MPH work she partnered with the Department of Health Services to evaluate the legal policy regarding TB patients crossing the US-Mexico Border. She has helped to coordinate and run free clinics for refugees at the University of Arizona, as well as homeless patients in Los Angeles.

During that time, Lena was able to do medical work in Bolivia, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama and Tanzania, which served to solidify her goals in life. She decided on doing Med Peds, given its broad knowledge in both fields and feeling it would provide the best training and preparation in places where there are few doctors. Initially, she completed her intern year at Geisinger Medical Center in Pennsylvania, but was given the opportunity to go to Miami to complete residency. With the diversity in the patient population, ability to work with the underserved and a great exposure to tropical medicine, she travelled south for the first time in her life and found it warm and amazing. She works with the international community on a daily basis but also had the chance to go to India, Costa Rica and Cambodia for rotations. Ultimately she wants to do public health based work overseas, specifically in Africa but also wants to focus on gender equality.

&nbsp;

We have piloted the fellowship for 3 years and have graduated five fellows. Their service and impact in our partner sites have been significant and since graduating, nearly all are continuing their work in low-resource settings. The map below shows the locations where our fellow graduates are currently working.

<strong>Alice Johnson </strong>is a rural health Liberian nurse who hails from Lofa County. She got involved in nursing care after witnessing and living through many terrible experiences during and after the Liberian Civil War. As a nurse working in the hospital’s emergency department, she saw that many patients, especially those coming from last mile villages, could not make it to the hospital or were too late. As a person, a nurse, and an aspiring Public Health Practitioner, Alice is motivated by the fact that health is a basic human right and that everyone deserves quality health care no matter who they are or where they live. In a post war country like Liberia, she believes her country needs a grass roots health care approach that involves community health workers. While she is not working, Alice likes listening to music and chatting with friends. Her favorite Liberian dish is spicy potatoes and greens with palm oil.

<strong>Anna Landau</strong> is currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year family medicine resident at UCLA/Harbor. Anna’s interest in medicine started at the early age of four, with a plastic stethoscope, and was fostered through many personal and family experiences with the health care system over the years. She studied chemistry and Latin American studies at Barnard College, and attended University of Arizona for both Medical School and to complete her Masters in Public Health. She was drawn to the philosophy of Family Medicine when she worked as a promotora for a community clinic in Tucson, AZ. It seemed to be the perfect mix of caring for individuals and communities. It was a way to meld her passion for preventive care and public health with medicine, while at the same time addressing social and economic disparities and barriers to healthcare access among women, immigrants and minorities. Growing up speaking Spanish and French, the extension to global health was a natural progression. Anna has worked in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, helping to establish sustainable locally-driven medical care, train lay health workers and help indigenous communities conduct health needs assessments. During her MPH work she partnered with the Department of Health Services to evaluate the legal policy regarding TB patients crossing the US-Mexico Border. She has helped to coordinate and run free clinics for refugees at the University of Arizona, as well as homeless patients in Los Angeles. She has been very involved the resident union as an elected delegate, focusing her work on Women in Medicine programming, contract negotiations, and staff &amp; patient safety issues.  She recently has been involved in an exciting new project with group visits focusing ways to combat teen obesity.

<strong>Lena Wong</strong> was born and raised in the wonderland that is New Jersey. She attended Rutgers University as an undergrad where following a few trips overseas to South Africa and China, decided to go to medical school with an interest in international health. She moved to Philadelphia to attend medical school at Temple University, mostly to watch her beloved Flyers play. During that time, Lena was able to do medical work in Bolivia, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama and Tanzania, which served to solidify her goals in life. She decided on doing Med Peds, given its broad knowledge in both fields and feeling it would provide the best training and preparation in places where there are few doctors. Initially, she completed her intern year at Geisinger Medical Center in Pennsylvania, but was given the opportunity to go to Miami to complete residency. With the diversity in the patient population, ability to work with the underserved and a great exposure to tropical medicine, she travelled south for the first time in her life and found it warm and amazing. She works with the international community on a daily basis but also had the chance to go to India, Costa Rica and Cambodia for rotations. Ultimately she wants to do public health based work overseas, specifically in Africa but also wants to focus on gender equality. She is really looking forward to meeting everyone and sharing experiences.
