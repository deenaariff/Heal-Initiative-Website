Kelvin is originally from the Los Angeles area. He did his undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley and majored in Cognitive Science, and his medical school training at Wake Forest University. He subsequently completed his residency in internal medicine at Olive View-UCLA Medical Canter, a county hospital in Los Angeles, where he was first exposed to global health after doing a rotation at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. After finishing residency, Kelvin completed a chief year, and stayed on board working as an academic hospitalist at Olive View.

Jessica grew up in the Pacific Northwest on a blackberry farm and then in Tacoma, WA. After graduating from Northwestern, she worked at the American Red Cross in the International Services Program, primarily working with local refugee and immigrant communities. She then attended the University of Washington School of Medicine, spending time in Antsirabe, Madagascar through UW’s Global Health Pathway. Jessica then moved east again to Boston University for internal medicine residency, during which time she participated in Boston Medical Center’s refugee clinic and also did a 6 week elective at JFK hospital in Monrovia, Liberia. She stayed at BU for an additional year as chief resident but is currently spending another six weeks in Liberia working with Partners in Health as a short-term clinician as part of their Ebola response. She is excited to hopefully return to Liberia through HEAL to continue to work on health system strengthening, quality improvement, and medical education.

Emilia is currently a pediatric chief resident at Jefferson Medical College/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, PA, where she also completed her pediatric residency. She grew up in California, where her family currently lives, and attended Smith College for her undergraduate work. Emilia worked in pharmaceutical development for 2 years and then attended the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey for medical school. She has been fortunate to have several global health experiences in eastern Africa during her training and is thrilled to learn and grow as a clinician and educator in the next two years.
