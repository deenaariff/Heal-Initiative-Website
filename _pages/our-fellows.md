She got involved in nursing care after witnessing&nbsp;and living through many&nbsp;terrible experiences during and after the Liberian Civil War.

As a person, a nurse, and an aspiring Public Health Practitioner, Alice is motivated by the fact that health is a basic human right and that everyone deserves quality health care no matter who they are or where they live. In a post war country like Liberia, she believes her country needs a grass roots health care approach that involves community health workers. While she is not working, Alice likes listening to music and chatting with friends. Her favorite Liberian dish is spicy potatoes and greens with palm oil.</p><p><a href="http://healtest.space/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AnnieKhan.png"><img class="   wp-image-503  aligncenter" src="http://healtest.space/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AnnieKhan-300x300.png" alt="" width="247" height="207"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Annie Khan&nbsp;</strong>is a native of the San Francisco Bay Area.

She studied chemistry and Latin American studies at Barnard College, and attended University of Arizona for both Medical School and to complete her Masters in Public Health. She was drawn to the philosophy of&nbsp;Family Medicine&nbsp;when she worked as a promotora for a community clinic in Tucson, AZ.

Growing up speaking Spanish and French, the extension to global health was a natural progression. Anna has worked in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, helping to establish sustainable locally-driven medical care, train lay health workers and help indigenous communities conduct health needs assessments. During her MPH work she partnered with the Department of Health Services to evaluate the legal policy regarding TB patients crossing the US-Mexico Border.
