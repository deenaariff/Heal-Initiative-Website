he HEAL initiative was born out of our many years of experience working in resource limited settings. Although we first met as volunteers in post-earthquake Haiti, we independently reached similar conclusions as we coordinated and worked with hundreds of health care volunteers: to have lasting impact as health professionals in resource limited settings the <i>will </i>to serve must be combined with the <i>expertise</i> to do so.

As post-earthquake Haiti turned into a chronic emergency, the need in health care turned out to mirror what we know from years of working in Liberia, or Haiti, or rural India and now Navajo nation.
<ol>
	<li><address>Local health professional capacity must be supported.</address></li>
	<li><address>The American health professionals who commit themselves to this mission must deeply understand the local context and have both the clinical and non-clinical skills to truly improve care.</address></li>
	<li><address>The relationships between individuals and institutions must be reciprocal, long-term and equitable.</address></li>
</ol>
We built the HEAL Initiative with these commitments in mind.  We are starting with our own vulnerable populations in the United States.   We are linking together health professionals who are dedicated to serving their community and learn from others like them all around the world.  It is the training program that we wished we had gone through.  It is a program that is structured to support and build local capacity in very poor areas for the long term.   It is financially sustainable in a way that is difficult to achieve in Global Health.

The HEAL Initiative is a model primed to have a profound impact on the lives of so many people needlessly suffering from diseases we know how to treat.

We invite you to join us in this work!

In Solidarity,

We <strong><em>pair</em></strong> dedicated <strong><em>U.S.</em></strong> providers with <strong><em>local</em></strong> health professionals who are already working in these communities. HEAL <strong><em>fellows</em></strong> work <strong><em>together</em></strong> on the <strong><em>frontline</em></strong> for<strong><em>two</em></strong> years.
