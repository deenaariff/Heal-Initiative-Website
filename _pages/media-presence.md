Must be a US citizen or permanent resident.</p><p><b>If I’m not a physician, can I still apply to be a HEAL fellow?</b></p><p>We will offer the HEAL Initiative fellowship to non-physicians only if they are currently working in one of our partner sites.   Application and selection for partner site fellows will be led by our partners.</p><p><b>I’m not a US citizen or green card holder; do you sponsor J1 visas?</b></p><p>At this time, applicants must be a US citizen or permanent resident.</p><p><b>Are there any requirements in terms of previous in-country experience, language, etc.?</b></p><p>While previous language experience is taken into account when determining an appropriate partner site, it is not required for admission into the program.</p><p><b>Should I submit letters of recommendation as part of my application?</b></p><p>No. We will be contacting the three references submitted in your application and therefore will not be requiring separate letters of recommendation.  However, please do list only references that know you very well.</p><p><b>When is the application deadline? When should I expect to hear back by?</b></p><p>November 15th at 11:59pm PST.  Interview invitations will be sent out within two weeks of the application deadline.  Interviews will take place in December and January.</p><p><b>How long is the commitment for HEAL Initiative fellows?</b></p><p>The HEAL Initiative is a two-year, full-time commitment that begins in July.</p><p><b>When is the HEAL Initiative month-long collaborative training?</b></p><p>The month-long training will be held at the start of the program, which will be July 2016 for fellows in the 2016-2018 cohort.</p><p><b>What are the current HEAL Initiative site placements?</b></p><p>Navajo Nation in New Mexico/Arizona, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, Mexico, Malawi, and India.  Other partner sites may also be available.</p><p><b>Can I choose which partner site to work in?</b></p><p>Once accepted, fellows will work together with their UCSF faculty, HEAL Initiative leadership team, and our partner sites to determine the best site for each individual fellow. Sites will be determined based on the fellow’s skills and the needs of each partner site.</p><p><b>Are the rotations between sites on a strict timetable? For instance, can I work for a longer/shorter time at each site before rotating?</b></p><p>Currently, rotations are four months long, although coordination amongst paired fellows and their mentors may allow for alteration in specific circumstances.</p><p><strong>I have a family at home. Is it still possible for me to do this fellowship?</strong></p><p>Yes. We will work with fellows on an individual basis to come up with an arrangement that best suits their situation.</p><p><b>How are HEAL fellows compensated?</b></p><p>Fellows will be paid a competitive Post Graduate Year 4 (PGY4) salary, that is equal to all other UCSF fellows.</p><p><b>Do fellows have to pay for the MPH?</b></p><p>No. The cost of the MPH is covered by the HEAL Initiative for all participating fellows.</p><p><b>What other costs are included in the HEAL Initiative program?</b></p><p>Airfare and health insurance will be covered by the HEAL Initiative for all fellows.  For HEAL Initiative fellows that are already employees of the partner site, their fellowship covers the online MPH and the month-long intensive bootcamp in July.</p><p><b>What if I already have my MPH? Are there alternative curricular offerings?</b></p><p>Fellows entering the program who already have their MPH will have the opportunity to pursue or non-degree programs.  This will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><strong>What kind of clinical work will I be doing?</strong></p><p>The clinical work varies greatly depending on the setting and needs of each site. Sites range from a rural clinic, where the focus will be on primary care, to an entirely hospital-based setting involving mostly inpatient services.</p><p><b>Who can I contact if I have any further questions?</b></p><p>Please email <a href="mailto:ghhm@ucsf.edu">ghhm@ucsf.edu</a> with any further questions.</p></div>";s:6:"filter";s:1:"1";s:11:"panels_info";a:6:{s:5:"class";s:30:"WP_Widget_Black_Studio_TinyMCE";s:3:"raw";b:0;s:4:"grid";i:0;s:4:"cell";i:0;s:2:"id";i:0;s:5:"style";a:1:{s:18:"background_display";s:4:"tile";}}}}s:5:"grids";a:1:{i:0;a:2:{s:5:"cells";i:1;s:5:"style";a:0:{}}}s:10:"grid_cells";a:1:{i:0;a:2:{s:4:"grid";i:0;s:6:"weight";i:1;}}}'
