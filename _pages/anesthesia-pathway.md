Through a partnership between the <strong><a title="HEAL Initiative" href="http://healinitiative.org/">HEAL Initiative</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://anesthesia.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">UCSF Department of Anesthesia &amp; Perioperative Care</a></strong>, this new anesthesia fellowship pathway offers a unique, advanced training opportunity for board-eligible and board-certified anesthesiologists (surgery and obstetric pathways coming soon).

As part of the UCSF family, our fellows will have opportunities to work with many ongoing global health initiatives at UCSF including the <a href="http://global.surgery.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Center for Global Surgical Studies</strong>,</a> <strong><a href="http://www.globalsurgery.org/" target="_blank">Global Partners in Anesthesia &amp; Surgery</a></strong>, and UCSF <strong><a href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">Global Health Sciences</a>.</strong>

All fellows are provided with an appointment in the UCSF Department of Anesthesia with clinical privileges at the San Francisco General Hospital. Fellows may pursue either a one or two-year pathway that includes opportunities for clinical service, teaching, policy and research at both domestic and international project sites.
<h4><strong>Fellowship Highlights:</strong></h4>

Fellows will be given the opportunity to incorporate advanced training in regional anesthesia, trauma &amp; obstetrics, and a fully-funded <strong><a title="UC Berkeley MPH" href="http://healinitiative.org/curriculum/mph/">Masters in Public Health from UC Berkeley</a> </strong>among other options as part of their fellowship. Faculty from the UCSF Department of Anesthesia and partnering institutions will provide didactics, simulation sessions and hands-on clinical teaching to augment the HEAL curriculum and provide a comprehensive and unique global health training program for our anesthesia fellows. Fellows will also participate as instructors and mentors for UCSF residents in our Global Health Clinical Scholars Pathway.

UCSF-appointed fellows are paired with fellows from their collaborating international or domestic project sites. All HEAL fellows (both UCSF-appointed and project site fellows) will join together in San Francisco for a month-long intensive <a title="Global Health Bootcamp" href="http://healinitiative.org/curriculum/bootcamp/">Bootcamp</a> at the beginning of the fellowship.

Anesthesia fellows will also receive additional learning opportunities after the July Bootcamp as outlined below.
