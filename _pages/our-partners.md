    In early 2007, at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation and the Ministry of Health in Malawi, PIH (Abwenzi Pa Za Umoyo (APZU) in Chichewa, the national language of Malawi) began operating in Malawi to replicate the rural initiative programs that have proven so successful in delivering HIV treatment and comprehensive primary health care in Rwanda and Lesotho. The Malawi Ministry of Health directed PIH and CHDI to the impoverished rural area of Neno, and in early 2007, the partners began to implement an ambitious plan to combat the disease. Like PIH’s other projects, APZU combines treatment for HIV patients with comprehensive, community-based health care and programs to combat the conditions of extreme poverty in which disease takes root, including hunger and lack of access to clean water and decent housing, schools and livelihoods. From Neno and ten other rural health centers, APZU serves about 100,000 people spread over an impoverished rural area about half the size of Rhode Island.

    In 2011, Partners In Health launched Compañeros En Salud (PIH/CES), a sister organization that works with rural government clinics in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas—one of the most marginalized regions in the state—to improve staffing, supplies, and links with local communities. In partnership with local health jurisdictions, PIH/CES revitalizes underperforming rural clinics, providing high-quality health care to vulnerable people who previously had no reliable health services. The program currently operates in six rural clinics and plans to expand to 10. By focusing on primary care, PIH/CES strives to improve health outcomes, as well as to decrease the impoverishing costs of seeking health care outside the community.

    Indian Health Service (IHS) is an entity within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, whose mission is to “raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska natives to the highest level.” While IHS provides health services to about 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska natives, the organization struggles to maintain an adequate healthcare workforce, with vacancy rates over 31% at some sites.
